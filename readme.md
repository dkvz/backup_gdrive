# Backup files and directories to Gdrive

Simple Perl script using https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive to backup files and directories to Google Drive.

**At some point it became almost impossible to setup Google drive for backups** So I used `rclone` with OneDrive, and it's a bash script now. There's no output when things go right.
